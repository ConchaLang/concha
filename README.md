# Concha
An interactive command shell who deals with Spanish natural 
language and outer world.

## Why Concha?
Because it is a shell... and a bad word in Latin America.

Concha aims to use Spanish natural language as a programming 
language, not just because it is cool, but because Spanish is
a pretty ruled language (it is officially handled by the Real 
Academia Espa√±ola, or RAE).

## Which are the main goals
There are two main goals:

* There are many natural languages who can answer questions 
related to an "internal world". Concha must interact with 
outer world, mainly through HTTP calls in the most flexible 
way possible.
* There are plenty of chatbots who interact with your phone 
to set up an alarm, to your favorite online store to buy 
things, but those are pre-trained tricks. Concha must be 
able to be taught about new tricks. This is not 
_deep learning_ but _deep teaching_.

When we, humans, teach others (and I'm not talking about 
learning, but teaching), we use natural language piled through
centuries to transfer wisdom, to tell how to do things, to
register queryable facts... Evolution must not be that wrong, 
otherwise we should be writing in P-Code or Assembler.
